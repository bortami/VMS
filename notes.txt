Users will be all Users
and an admin boolean

if boolean is true
makes them an admin
so organization with have an admin table with organization id and user id

if admin, show organization options

if not, don't


hours- will have a project key, and and organization key. both don't have to be not null, if hours only has project, project already belongs to organization, so trickle down ownership.
Hours can be to an organization if general volunteer hours (maybe look into non-billable hours?)

look into a react chart component

react table component
