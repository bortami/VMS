Front End Capstone - Volunteer Management System

View before Login

non logged in visitors can search for volunteer Opportunities. They view a condensed version of the project (name- location -description) They will need to sign up to join projects, groups, or to view contact information.
Non-logged in navbar will show a search and the option to sign up or login. I plan to use annoying modals to get people to sign up when they click something only accessible to members.

After Login for Admin/Organization
